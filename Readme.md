# React 101 

Well, Here I applied the concepts of React in this project sort of DashBoard 

## Getting Started 

First of all, We need to install this backend: 

1. Copy this repository in a directory of your local machine:  

``` 
https://github.com/davidjj76/nodepop-api 
``` 

This repository was created by David my teacher in Keepcoding 

2. Run this command: 

``` 
$ npm install 
``` 

3. Run the app: 
``` 
$ npm run start 
``` 

Now, your backend will be running and you can see it in this URL http://localhost:3001/swagger/ (can be 3000 or another)
